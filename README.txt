# HuntTheWumpus
Basic text based game based on the classic Hunt the Wumpus

Originally started as an exercise from Bjarne Stroustroup's "Programming Principles and Practice".
This is my first "big" project ive attempted.
The stream class in the main.cpp file is taken from the book and tweaked to fit the needs of the program.
I hope anyone who sees this can provide some tips or some criticism.
